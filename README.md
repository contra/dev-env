## What is this

This is my base developer environment as a VMWare Workstation image.

## OS?

Ubuntu 13.04 was chosen because it works well with VMWare - you shouldn't have any issues dropping it straight in.

## What's on it

- OS essentials (all of the latest updates, git-core, build-essential, latest kernel, etc.)
- NodeJS Latest (Installed via [nave](https://raw.github.com/isaacs/nave) which is at ~/nave.sh)
- MongoDB Latest
- Redis Latest
- Elastic Search Latest
- Sublime Text 3
  - Sidebar Enhancements plugin
  - Jade syntax plugin
  - Coffeescript syntax plugin
  - Gitgutter plugin
